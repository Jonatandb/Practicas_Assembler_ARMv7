Hi

Thank you for downloading these source files and for your interest in my book.
As mentioned in the blurb, this book is based on my Raspberry Pi book of a similar name, and as such, there is a significant cross-over. 

The file names relate directly to the program number used in each chapter.
Thus the file 'prog3a.s' is the source file for Program 3a in the book.
Files may require running, assembling and executing differently 
depending on their structure, so please check the book at the appropriate point.

Some files, especially those relating to programming the GPIO port, may require minor modifications.

Please do check out my website at www.brucesmith.info.

Feel free to drop me a line at:

feedback@brucesmith.info

I read all emails and try to reply to as many as possible.
If you feel so inclined, please leave an honest review of the book on your Amazon site.


Keep healthy.

Regards
Bruce
