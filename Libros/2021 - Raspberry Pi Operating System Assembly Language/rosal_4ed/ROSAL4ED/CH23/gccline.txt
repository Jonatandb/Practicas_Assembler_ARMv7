For both programs ensure you are in the correct directory in Terminal.

For GPIO 22 copy the first line  (line 8 below) and then past into Terminal and press
the Enter or Return key to assemble the program. Then copy or type in the next line (9) to execute the program.

For GPIO17 use line 11 as above, and then line 12 at above.

gcc -march="armv8-a" -g -o GPIO22 prog23a_22.s
./GPIO22

gcc -march="armv8-a" -g -o GPIO17 prog23a_17.s
./GPIO22
